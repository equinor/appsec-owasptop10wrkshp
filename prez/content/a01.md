## Primary defenses 1/2

- Enforce least privileges
- Deny by default
- Validate permissions on every request
- Thoroughly review the authorization logic of chosen tools and technologies,
implementing custom logic if necessary
- Prefer feature and attribute based access control over RBAC

## Primary defenses 2/2

- Ensure lookup IDs are not accessible even when guessed or cannot
be tampered with
- Enforce authorization checks on static resources
- Verify that authorization checks are performed in the right location
- Exit safely when authorization checks fail
- Implement appropriate logging
- Create unit and integration test cases for authorization logic

Note:

- 10 minute break
