# A02:2021<br>Cryptographic Failures

>Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which again could lead to exposure of sensitive data.<br><br>In previous lists this vulnerability was named _Sensitive Data Exposure_

Note:

- OWASP changed the name due to this is more a broad
symptom rather than a root cause. The focus should be on failures related to
cryptography (or lack thereof), which again could lead to exposure of
sensitive data.

## Example scenario

- An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. <br>However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.
