# A02:2021<br>Cryptographic Failures

>Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which again could lead to exposure of sensitive data.<br><br>In previous lists this vulnerability was named _Sensitive Data Exposure_

Note:

- OWASP changed the name due to this is more a broad
symptom rather than a root cause. The focus should be on failures related to
cryptography (or lack thereof), which again could lead to exposure of
sensitive data.

---

## Example scenario

- Application uses two way hash function.
- An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. <br>However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.

Note:

- Ask after 4 minutes if they want the last hint
- Give them a link to tunnelsup to [Tunnelsup hash analyzer](https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/) to help analyze hash
