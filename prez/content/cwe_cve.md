- Evaluating coverage of tools targeting these weaknesses
- Leveraging a common baseline standard for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

- CVE program is overseen by the MITRE corporation <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- CVE reports can come from anywhere
  - Vendors, researchers; anyone can discover a flaw and bring it to someone’s attention <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
