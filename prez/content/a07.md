## A07:2021<br>Identification and Authentication Failures 1/2

There may be authentication weaknesses if your application:

- Permits automated attacks <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
- Permits brute force or other automated attacks <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
- Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as "Password1" or "admin/admin" <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->

- 1: e.g. credential stuffing (Attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords)
- 2: Do not have rate limiting on login
