## A09:2021<br>Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs any time:

- Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, are not logged <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
- Warnings and errors generate no inadequate, or unclear log messages <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
- Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
- Logs are only stored locally <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
- Penetration testing and scans by dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools, do not trigger alerts <!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->
