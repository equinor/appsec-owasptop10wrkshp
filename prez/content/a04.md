# A04:2021<br>Insecure Design

>A new category for 2021 focuses on risks related to design and architectural
flaws, with a call for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and
reference architectures.

## A04:2021<br>Insecure Design

>Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.”<br><br>An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks.

## Primary defenses

- Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business
logic, and key flows <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals to
help evaluate and design security and privacy-related controls <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Integrate security language and controls into user stories <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are
resistant to the threat model <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending
on the exposure and protection needs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
